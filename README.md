# [C]ompanion [A]nalysis and [N]on-[D]etection in [I]nterferometric [D]ata

This is a PyQT5 Graphical user interface for the CANDID algorithm to find faint companion around star in interferometric data in the OIFITS format. This tool allows to systematically search for faint companions in OIFITS data, and if not found, estimates the detection limit. This code is presented in the article [Gallenne et al. 2015](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...579A..68G/abstract), although it has evolved slightly since the paper was published.

CANDID code/install/examples can be find in the original repository [here](https://github.com/amerand/CANDID). CANDID has to be installed as described in the repository.

To run the GUI, go to the directory then type:

```
GUIcandid 
```

The GUI will open.
